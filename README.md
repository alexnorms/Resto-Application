<h1>Resto-Application</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p> This application was developed as the term project for ECSE223 (Model-Based Programming) at McGill University. The developement took about 3 months and was done by a team of six people, myself included. </p>
<p> The purpose of the app is to help restaurant owners by managing their restaurant's ordering and billing system. Tables can be added at desired locations to create a virtual version of their restaurant layout. A desired amount of chairs can then be added to any table. Using these tables, waiters can reserve them, place orders and issue bills. The waiter can split the bill any way the customer wants to. A menu can be uploaded and modified through the app. </p>

The UI can be seen below:

<h2>New material and technologies</h2>
<p>This was the first application I have ever made implementing a UI and a persistence layer. Pretty much everything about the project was new to me. Notably, I learned how to:
<ul>
  <li>Make class diagrams and sequence digrams.</li>
  <li>How to use Umple to generate code. </li>
  <li>How to make a UI in java. </li>
  <li>How to link the backend to the frontend in a simple java application.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h2>Improvements we could make</h2>
<p>Looking back, a lot of things could have been done better. The first thing I would change would be the UI. As the image shows, everything is on one page, crammed together. It is in no way appealing to the eye and looks very complex to use. Some colour would also have been nice. I would replace some of the panels such as "Add a table" for separate pages or pop-ups. Making it more user-friendly would definitely be the next step. </p>

<p>Despite this small critique, I am still very proud of this project and am grateful for my teammates with whom I have built this <i>chef-d'oeuvre</i>.</p>
